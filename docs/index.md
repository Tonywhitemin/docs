# Get started 

The `mljar-supervised` is an Automated Machine Learning Python package that works with tabular data. It is designed to save time for a data scientist :sunglasses:. It abstracts the common way to preprocess the data, construct the machine learning models, and perform hyper-parameters tuning to find the best model :trophy:. It is no black-box as you can see exactly how the ML pipeline is constructed (with a detailed Markdown report for each ML model).

The `mljar-supervised` will help you with:

- explaining and understanding your data,
- trying many different machine learning models,
- creating Markdown reports from analysis with details about all models,
- saving, re-running and loading the analysis and ML models.
